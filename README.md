# bankstersheet
The "bankstersheet" will be a platform to get an overview of your existing stocks in nearly real time. Like "bloomberg", but not as cool ;) . I planned to develop a backend with Java Spring services and an react.js frontend for easy web access. Additionally I have planned to setup a CI/CD pipeline.
